This a data package that gives the GC percentage of human genome for
builds hg18, hg19 & hg38 and mouse genome for builds mm9 & mm10. The
data object, named after the build, is a list with each element giving a
vector of values for a chromosome. The GC percentage is the proportion
of nucleotides that are GC in a 1000 base window. The windows begin with
bases 1-1000 and slide 100 bases at a time.
